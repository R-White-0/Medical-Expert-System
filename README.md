## Introduction 
Artificial Intelligence has become popular over the years. The medical field without a doubt can beifit from its growth.
The aim of this project is to create a medical expert system that will assist medical practitioners in identifying possible 
cases of COVID-19.

## ES
An expert system contains its knowledge usually in the form of a database, or knowledgebase. 
By decoupling the knowledge from the actual software algorithm, an expert system can navigate through the database of facts to determine classifications and make decisions. 
The database is typically created by a human expert, and as such, the extent of knowledge that an expert system contains is typically confined to that
of the human providing the content.

## Technologies
project is created with:
* Prolog
* Using a Knowledge base

## Project-File
[Moh project file](https://github.com/R-White-0/UTECH-Medical-ES-Project/tree/master/AI%20UTECH%20Project)

## Setup
